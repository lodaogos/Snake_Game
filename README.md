The game will automatically start after you copy the html file path to the browser. You can move the snake by using arrows key. The objective is to eat the apple (the red block) and to get highest score as possible.

As your snake gets bigger, you should be careful to not eat yourself. If you do, the game over text will pop up and the game will stop. You can restart the game by pressing the reset button.
